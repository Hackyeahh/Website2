# Personal Site

Instead of being built with raw html, css, and js like the original [website](http://www.github.com/Hackyeahh/Website), I will be using React.js and Sass. More features like:

* Smooth & cool animations
* Better projects section
* Cleaner code btw too :)
* RESPONSIVE so website on mobile looks good (css grid)
